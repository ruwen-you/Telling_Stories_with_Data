### Testing Plan
I used the following script for my user interviews:

* Please walk through the stories and think aloud. (What are you thinking along the way?)
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?
* What parts were confusing?
* What parts were most informative?
* Was there any information you thought was missing?
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?
* What each chart means to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?

My target audience is the parents whose children are in K-12 schools.

I tested this storyboard with three people (but not target audience).

### Feedback
* Summary of the story
  ** First User - This story tells me how COVID-19 influences K-12 schools and learnings. (Follow-up - What about the parts about parents?) I didn't pay attention to the last part much maybe because you didn't give me the specific suggestions. But I can see you want to provide something for parents.
  ** Second User - 
* Target audience 
  ** First User - Either parents or ed-tech companies. I think both work.
  ** Second User - Parents. Because you give suggestions to parents.
  ** Third User - I prefer ed-tech companies rather than parents.
* 1st Vis
  ** The map is too abstract. It's hard to notice it's a map in the very beginning. 
  ** Didn't notice the unit is country, thought it's school because of the title. 
  ** The numbers of schools and students are not intuitive. Percentage can work better to tell me if it's a large number.
* 2nd Vis
  ** Don't know how to read this. So many terms I don't get (RIT score, Typical Last Day, Max/Min Achievement). I want more explanations of these terms.
* 3rd Vis
  ** Don't know why
