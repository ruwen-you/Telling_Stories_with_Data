# Final Project - The pandemic could result in learning loss, but parents' involvement in the remote learning may help their kids.

### Testing Plan
I used the following script for my user interviews:

* Please walk through the stories and think aloud. (What are you thinking along the way?)
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?
* What parts were confusing?
* What parts were most informative?
* Was there any information you thought was missing?
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?
* What each chart means to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?

My target audience is the parents whose children are in K-12 schools.

I tested this storyboard with three people (but not target audience).

### Feedback
* Summary of the story
  * First User - This story tells me how COVID-19 influences K-12 schools and learnings. (Follow-up - What about the parts about parents?) I didn't pay attention to the last part much maybe because you didn't give me the specific suggestions. But I can see you want to provide something for parents.
  * Second User - COVID-19 brings the transition from traditional to remote learning and parents need help.
  * Third User - 
* Target audience 
  * First User - Either parents or ed-tech companies. I think both work.
  * Second User - Parents. Because you give suggestions to parents.
  * Third User - I prefer ed-tech companies rather than parents. You need to provide more useful things if your target is parents.
* 1st Vis
  * The map is too abstract. It's hard to notice it's a map in the very beginning. 
  * Didn't notice the unit is country, thought it's school because of the title. 
  * The numbers of schools and students are not intuitive. Percentage can work better to tell me if it's a large number.
  * I like how you set the background in the very beginning.
* 2nd Vis
  * Don't know how to read this. So many terms I don't get (RIT score, Typical Last Day, Max/Min Achievement). I want more explanations of these terms.
  * Can't get the conclusion about learning loss and learning gap. Don't know which part is learning loss or learning gap in the data vis.
  * Projection is always something I suspect. I may want to know more data points and background about the research to persuade me. 
  * Instead of projection, it may be more helpful to know what the students are really doing at home and how it has influenced the learning. 
  * Before this visualization, you talk about the world. But who is the target in this visualization? Still the world? Or the US? Or others?
* 3rd Vis
  * Hard to connect the first three pie charts with the last one. What's the relationship between them? Can't see the meaning directly.
  * The first pie chart is unnecessary. There is no need to show how children behave. You should show how parents behave.
  * Maybe add more survey data here. It's an interesting topic. I want to know more about how parents help the learning at home.
  * Does all the data come from the same survey? How many participants? I want to know the details.
  * If you want to show "You are not alone." It's better to show how many participants.
  * What are the rest of each pie chart? For example, in the first one, 80% agrees that my child is handling the transition better than I am. What about the rest 20%. They don't agree or they think much better instead of only better? It's not clear.
* 4th Vis
  * This one is pretty clear and powerful.
  * It's not coming from the real data. It's more conceptual. But you need to tell the readers. 
* 5th Vis
  * The header of each chart is not clear. The bar chart - Decrease of learning time, didn't notice it's from tradional to online.
  * These charts are too shallow. I prefer to learn more about the detailed data - how ed-tech can help learning.
  * Ed-tech is not the same as online learning. It would be helpful if you can show what types of tools and platforms are available in ed-tech.
* Whole Story
  * It's easy to understand what you want to bring to the parents.
  * You can add more details to the last part. It's helpful if parents can know how ed-tech can help learning.
