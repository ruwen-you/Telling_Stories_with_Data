## About me
Hi everyone! <br>
-> I'm **Ruwen (Ruin)**. <br>
-> a master student from **METALS** program (Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences) at **HCII** (Human-Computer Interaction Institute) of **CMU** (Carnegie Mellon University). <br>
-> I have **passion** to empower education and learning with technology. <br>
-> I'm actively looking for **jobs** as a product manager in ed-tech. <br>
-> My **life goal** is to create my own popular ed-tech product for K12 and start a tech-based school in the future. <br>
-> I always believe **learning data** can better tap students' potential and personalize the learning process, which can make learning insteresting, effective and efficient. <br>
-> But people need to **understand data** first !!! <br>

## What I hope to learn
Learning data is complex and hard to display. That's why I came to the course. I want to learn and practice how to tell good stories to students, teachers and parents so that they can easily get insights from the learning data. We can easily get big data thanks to today's technology. But how to turn data into information, and that information to knowledge and insights? That's what I hope to learn.
