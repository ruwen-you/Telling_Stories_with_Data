# Assignment 2 - Visualizing Government Debt

In this assignment, I chose three ways to visualize the same data - [General government debt on OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). **You can see how the visualization changes the stories of the data.** The visualization is interactive so that you can play with it.

Background: The main character of our story is general government debt-to-GDP ratio. It measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

## Bar Chart

### 2018 Debt-to-GDP Ratio In Order Across The World

This is a bar chart to show the Debt-to-GDP ratio of some countries across the world in 2018. You can easily see it from lower to higher. Japan and Greece are the highest among all of the countries. They have a great risk of debt crisis. In comparison, most countries in Europe have lower Debt-to-GDP ratio, which means they are more sustainable.

### The Turning Point Of Debt-to-GDP Ratio: 2008 Financial Crisis

This is a grid of line charts to show the time series of the Debt-to-GDP ratio of countries across the world. You can easily compare the trends of different countries. Most countries experienced a turning point to go up around 2007-2008 because of 2008 Financial Crisis.

## Beeswarm Plot

### Japan Keeps A rapid Growth of The Debt-to GDP Ratio
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/3232983" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3232983/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This is a beeswarm plot. You can see the trends of different coutries. At the same time, you can also compare the countries in the same year. Among all of the countries, we can see Japn keep a rapid growth of the Debt-to-GPD ratio. From 1999, Japan keeps to be the highest among all of the countries.

## Comparison of Visualizations
Based on the explanations of each visualization, you can see the power of storytelling. The bar chart is the best to compare the countries in the same year. You can easily see the order and the difference between them. Grid of Line Charts is the best way to compare the trends of the time series. The last one - beeswarm plot. I chose this one because I want compare the ratio in the same year but at the same time compare the trends. The aim is the combination of the first and second. Japan is so salient in this visualization because of both the trend and the order.
