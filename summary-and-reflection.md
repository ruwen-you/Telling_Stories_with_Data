  # Summary and Reflection
  
  ## How did I write the story
  I started the story from the project outline, which is based on the basic structure of a story in the book by Scott Barinato - Good Charts: The HBR Guide to Making Smarter, More Persuasive Data Visualizations to create the charts, including Setup, Conflict and Resolution. 
  
  Then I started to look for existing data source. I had to give up some ideas because I couldn't find any related data. So based on the data I could find, I started to brainstorm how I could narrow down the topic and what visualizations I cound make. Then I started the detailed storyline and define the target audience as parents.
  
  In order to gather feedback, I created the storyboards with rough data visualization wireframes and invited three participants to test. During the testing, they walked through the wireframes and did think-alouds along the way. 
  
  Based on the feedback I got, I did iterations on both the storyline and the data visualizations. In the end, finalize the whole story in Shorthand.
  
  ## Key takeaways
* Ideas are good, but should be based on available data

It's better to start from data instead of ideas. Along the way, I gave up a lot of ideas because I couldn't find any data related to these ideas. For example, in the beginning I want to show how students' habits has been changed because of remote learning or how students' learning outcome changed. But there is no data. So I started from getting insights from the existing data. 

* Focus on one thing at one time, don't deliver too much in one data vis

I always wanted to deliver more in one data visualization. But when I tested it with the participants, I found that they always ignored some information and tried the focus on only one conclusion. Then I simpified all the complex data vis and tried to focus on only one insight in one vis.

* Always consider what your target audience want

This was the biggest gain I got from the testing. At the beginning, I collected a lot of data about how parents responded to COVID-19. One of the participant gave the feedback that parents may be more curious about others instead of themselves. They already know how themselves are thinking about. It's better to provide other perspectives because that's what they want.
