## The Two Questions
When you start designing visualization, ask the following questions about the nature and the purpose of your visualization:
* Is the information conceptual or data-driven?
* Am I declaring something or exploring something?

### Conceptual vs Data-Driven
|            | Conceptual | Data-Driven |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Focus** | Ideas | Statistics |
| **Goals** | Simpify, teach | Inform, Enlighten |
