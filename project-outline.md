### Project Outline

This project is the final project of CMU 2020 Summer Course - Telling Stories with Data. In this project, I will create data visualizations to tell a story of what kind of impact the COVID-19 pandemic have made on the K-12 education and how can parents help their kids get better in the remote learning. The target audience of this story is the parents of K-12 students. After reading the story, I hope it can help the parents to better deal with the current situation of kids' learning at home.

I'll follow the basic structure of a story in the book by Scott Barinato - [Good Charts: The HBR Guide to Making Smarter, More Persuasive Data Visualizations](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Charts-Smarter-Persuasive-Visualizations/dp/1633690709) to create the charts in my story. The structure is Setup, Conflict and Resolution.

#### Setup - "Let me show you some reality."
Most schools around the world are either closed or limited open now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, more than 90% of the schools has changed the traditional face-to-face learning to remote. Students are learning at home now, which means parents are more involved in their kids' learning.

#### Conflict - "Here is something that happened to that reality."
Some research found out the these changes of schools and learnings may cause severe learning loss to the K-12 students. A lot of parents are worried about their kids' learning now. The remote learning totally changes students' learning habits. The students are not satisfied with their remote learning.

#### Resolution - "Here is the new reality after the conflict."
Surveys has shown that more and more parents are getting involved and spending more time on their kids' learning. But parents need to learn how to help with the remote learning. Besides, they can utilize online learning and ed-tech tools to help with their kids' learning. As a result, it may reduce the learning loss which could be caused by COVID-19.
